      Hello, and welcome to my simple page! My name is Joey, and I'm most interested in software, games, technology, and the people who use them.
      During my time studying psychology at University of Illinois (Chicago), I originally worked towards becoming an effective therapist.
      During the long hours alone in my dormroom, I became enthralled with software, coding, and game development. Game development has been a key component of my life ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduating from UIC (2019) with my newfound passion, I studied Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at DePaul University in hopes to work in the combined realm of software and behavioral psychology.
      While at DePaul, I was immersed in a world of user research, data science, group cooperation, business processes, design solutions and much more.
      After receiving my masters of science in HCI (2022), I moved with my mom and three dogs away from Illinois.
      Currently, I am searching for full-time user experience, game development, data science, web development, and research positions in southern Florida with a preference for remote work.
